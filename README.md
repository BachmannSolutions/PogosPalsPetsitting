# Pogo's Pals Petsitting

## Change Log
2018-11-05:	Updated to include Jquery  
2018-10-29:	Initial release

## Description
This is the start of a landing page for a petsitting website, [Pogo's Pals Petsitting](https://www.pogospalspetsitting.com). The company owns the domain, but has it auto-directing clients to the Facebook page. The company is looking to better market their product through the domain and use Facebook as a supporting tool, not as a primary tool moving forward. 

This website primary uses [Booststrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Also used is CSS and Jquery.

## Installation
This program does not require installation. You should just run the index.html file.

## Support
Please reach out to BachmannSolutions@gmail.com, not the client, if you are experiencing technical issues.

## Roadmap
This landing page is the start of something bigger. Next updates look to include: 
- embedded links to Pogo's Pals Petsitting Facebook comments and Yelp
- revamping colors choices to better align with company branding colors

## Contributing
Any ideas, comments, concerns can be directed to BachmannSolutions@gmail.com.
